# dropbox-groomer

Google Apps Script to prune my Dropbox/Screenshots folder. Dropbox has some nifty features wrt screenshots such as uploading and copying Dropbox link to clipboard after taking a screenshot, but I pay for Google storage. I have an IFTTT applet set up to move Dropbox screenshots to Google Drive, but since there is no IFTTT action to delete files this GAS script takes care of that
